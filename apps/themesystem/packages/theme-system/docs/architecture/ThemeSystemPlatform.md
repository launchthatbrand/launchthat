## Implementation Approach

### Core SDK Changes

The npm package would need significant changes to support this model:

```typescript
// New ThemeProvider with remote theme support
interface ThemeProviderProps {
  // Allow explicit themes and/or remote themes
  themes?: ThemeDefinition[];

  // Remote themes configuration
  remote?: {
    enabled: boolean;
    apiKey?: string;
    endpoint?: string;
    categories?: string[];
    cacheStrategy?: "memory" | "localStorage" | "indexedDB";
    offlineMode?: "strict" | "fallback";
    preload?: string[] | boolean;
  };

  // Other props...
  children: React.ReactNode;
}
```

### Theme Fetching and Caching

```typescript
// Theme fetching service
class ThemeService {
  private cache: Map<string, ThemeDefinition> = new Map();
  private endpoint: string;

  constructor(config: RemoteConfig) {
    this.endpoint = config.endpoint || "https://api.themesystem.com/v1";
  }

  // Fetch available themes
  async getAvailableThemes(): Promise<ThemeSummary[]> {
    // Fetch from API with caching
  }

  // Get a specific theme with full definition
  async getTheme(id: string): Promise<ThemeDefinition> {
    // Check cache first
    if (this.cache.has(id)) {
      return this.cache.get(id)!;
    }

    // Fetch from API
    const theme = await this.fetchTheme(id);

    // Cache the result
    this.cache.set(id, theme);

    return theme;
  }

  // Preload multiple themes
  async preloadThemes(ids: string[]): Promise<void> {
    // Fetch multiple themes in parallel
  }
}
```

### Client-Side Integration

```tsx
// In user's application
import { ThemeProvider } from "@acme/theme-system";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider
      remote={{
        enabled: true,
        apiKey: "user_api_key",
        preload: ["popular-theme-1", "popular-theme-2"],
        cacheStrategy: "localStorage",
      }}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

### Theme Selection Component

```tsx
// Enhanced theme selector with remote themes
import { useTheme } from "@acme/theme-system";

function ThemeSelector() {
  const { availableThemes, currentTheme, setTheme, isLoading } = useTheme();

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading themes...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div className="theme-selector">
      {availableThemes.map((theme) => (
        <button
          key={theme.id}
          className={theme.id === currentTheme.id ? "active" : ""}
          onClick={() => setTheme(theme.id)}
        >
          <img src={theme.previewUrl} alt={theme.name} />
          <span>{theme.name}</span>
        </button>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Scaling to 1000+ Themes

### Challenges with Scale

1. **Discovery Problem**

   - Users cannot browse 1000+ themes effectively
