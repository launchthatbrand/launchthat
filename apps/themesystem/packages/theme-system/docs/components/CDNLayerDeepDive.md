# CDN Layer Deep Dive

## Overview

The Content Delivery Network (CDN) layer is a critical component of the ThemeSystem platform, responsible for the global distribution of theme assets. This document provides a comprehensive overview of the CDN architecture, its integration with the rest of the platform, and best practices for implementation.

## Role in the Architecture

The CDN layer serves several crucial functions in the ThemeSystem architecture:

1. **Global Distribution**: Delivers theme assets (CSS, images, documentation) from edge locations close to end users
2. **Performance Optimization**: Reduces latency for theme application and switching
3. **Traffic Management**: Handles high-volume requests without overwhelming origin servers
4. **Security Enhancement**: Provides DDoS protection and traffic filtering
5. **Cost Reduction**: Minimizes bandwidth costs from origin servers

## CDN Architecture

The ThemeSystem CDN implementation is designed as a multi-tier distribution system:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[End User] -->|Request Theme Asset| B[CDN Edge Location]
    B -->|Cache Hit| A
    B -->|Cache Miss| C[CDN Regional Cache]
    C -->|Cache Hit| B
    C -->|Cache Miss| D[Origin Shield]
    D -->|Request| E[S3 Origin Bucket]
    E -->|Response| D
    D -->|Cache| C
    C -->|Distribute| B
    B -->|Serve| A
```

### Key Components

1. **Edge Locations**:

   - Globally distributed points of presence (PoPs)
   - First point of contact for user requests
   - Serve cached content with minimal latency

2. **Regional Caches**:

   - Second-tier caching layer
   - Reduce load on origin shield
   - Optimize for regional access patterns

3. **Origin Shield**:

   - Protective layer in front of origin servers
   - Aggregation point for cache misses
   - Reduces origin server load

4. **Origin Server**:
   - S3 buckets storing authoritative theme assets
   - Only accessed when content is not in any cache layer
   - Protected from direct user access

## CDN Provider Options

The ThemeSystem architecture supports multiple CDN providers, each with specific advantages:

### Cloudflare

**Advantages**:

- Extensive global network
- Advanced security features (WAF, Bot Protection)
- Workers platform for edge computing
- Affordable pricing model

**Implementation Details**:

- Custom cache keys for theme versioning

### AWS CloudFront

**Advantages**:

### Multi-CDN Strategy

For maximum reliability and performance, ThemeSystem can implement a multi-CDN strategy:

- Primary CDN handles regular traffic
- Secondary CDN provides failover
- DNS-based traffic steering for optimal routing
- Performance-based CDN selection

## Cache Strategy

### Cache Rules by Content Type

| Content Type   | Cache TTL | Cache Control                                      | Invalidation Frequency |
| -------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Theme CSS      | 7 days    | public, max-age=604800                             | On theme update        |
| Preview Images | 30 days   | public, max-age=2592000                            | On image update        |
| Metadata JSON  | 1 hour    | public, max-age=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400 | On metadata change     |
| Documentation  | 1 day     | public, max-age=86400                              | On doc update          |

### Cache Key Strategy

The CDN cache key structure is designed to optimize hit rates while ensuring version accuracy:

```
/{theme-id}/{version}/{asset-type}/{file-name}
```

For example:

- `/glass-theme/v1.2.0/css/glass-theme.min.css`
- `/brutalist-theme/latest/preview/thumbnail.png`

### Cache Invalidation Strategies

1. **Versioned URLs**: Primary strategy - new versions get new URLs
2. **Selective Invalidation**: For urgent updates to existing assets
3. **Wildcard Invalidation**: For theme-wide changes (e.g., `/glass-theme/*`)
4. **Scheduled Purges**: Low-priority assets refreshed during off-peak hours

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. File Optimization

- **CSS Minification**: Reduces file size before distribution
- **Gzip/Brotli Compression**: Further reduces transfer size
- **Image Optimization**: WebP format with fallbacks
- **HTTP/2 or HTTP/3**: Reduces connection overhead

### 2. Cache Warming

- Proactive cache population after theme updates
- Scheduled warming for popular themes
- Regional distribution prioritization based on usage patterns

### 3. Request Collapsing

- Combine multiple identical requests during cache misses
- Reduce origin load during high-traffic events
- Implement request coalescing at the origin shield layer

### 4. Edge Computing

Using edge functions (Cloudflare Workers or Lambda@Edge) for:

- Dynamic theme transformations
- A/B testing of themes
- User-specific theme customizations
- Analytics capture without origin requests

## Security Implementation

### 1. HTTPS Enforcement

- TLS 1.3 for all connections
- HSTS implementation
- OCSP stapling
- Modern cipher suites only

### 2. Access Controls

- Signed URLs for premium themes
- Token authentication for restricted assets
- Geo-restriction capabilities for regional themes

### 3. DDoS Protection

- Bot detection and challenge systems
- Traffic anomaly detection
- Automatic mitigation responses

### 4. Content Security

- Strict CORS policy implementation
- Content-Security-Policy headers
- Subresource Integrity checks
- Malicious content scanning

## CDN Monitoring and Analytics

## Implementation Examples

### Cloudflare Worker for Theme Switching

```javascript
addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  event.respondWith(handleRequest(event.request));
});

async function handleRequest(request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);

  // Handle theme asset requests
  if (url.pathname.startsWith("/assets/themes/")) {
    // Extract theme ID and version from URL
    const pathParts = url.pathname.split("/");
    const themeId = pathParts[3];
    const version = pathParts[4] || "latest";

    // Construct origin URL
    const originUrl = new URL(request.url);
    originUrl.hostname = "themes-storage.s3.amazonaws.com";

    // Add caching headers based on asset type
    const response = await fetch(originUrl, request);
    const modified = new Response(response.body, response);

    // Apply appropriate cache control based on asset type
    if (url.pathname.endsWith(".css")) {
      modified.headers.set("Cache-Control", "public, max-age=604800");
    } else if (url.pathname.match(/\.(png|jpg|webp)$/i)) {
      modified.headers.set("Cache-Control", "public, max-age=2592000");
    } else if (url.pathname.endsWith(".json")) {
      modified.headers.set(
        "Cache-Control",
        "public, max-age=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400",
      );
    }

    return modified;
  }

  // Pass through other requests
  return fetch(request);
}
```
